Items implemented for the second milestone:
- Minimax AI for choosing which direction cars will turn
  (when second car moves up to front of line, has chance to change direction to confuse player;
  if it does choose to change direction, the minimax tree is used to decide which would be most challenging direction)
- Cars turn correctly now
- Added indication sprite for desired turn direction next to each car. The sprite will change color
  to show time remaining before car moves on its own
- Split-flat display for overall game timer (will eventually be used to determine when to end the level)
- 4 lane car generation, queuing, pulling up, and advancement through intersection
